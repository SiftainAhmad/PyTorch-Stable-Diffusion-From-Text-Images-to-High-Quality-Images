"""Summary of the VAE_Encoder Class
Initialization:

Defines a sequence of convolutional, residual, and attention layers to process input images.
Includes several stages of downsampling and feature extraction to reduce the spatial dimensions 
and increase the feature richness progressively.
Forward Pass:

Processes the input through the defined sequence of layers.
Applies asymmetric padding during downsampling to maintain proper dimensions.
Splits the final output into mean and log-variance components.
Uses the reparameterization trick to generate the latent representation
 by combining the mean and standard deviation with noise.
Scales the resulting latent variable by a constant factor for stability and consistency."""
